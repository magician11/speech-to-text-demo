# React App Starting Point

Simple and solid starting point for React.js apps.

Uses: eslint, webpack, sass, es6

## To start..

- Get a copy of this boilerplate by typing `git clone https://github.com/magician11/react-starting-point.git [my-project]`
- Then `cd [my-project]`

## To get this running..

- Install the packages by typing `npm install`
- To run the local server, then type `npm run dev`
- and then to view your app running, goto [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## To make this basis for your new project..

- Goto GitHub and [create a new repository](https://github.com/new)
- Now remove the current remote that is pointing to this starting point repo, by typing `git remote rm origin`
- Now you can add this starting point to your new repo you just created by typing `git remote add origin [https://github.com/your-username/your-new-repo.git]`
- Edit this README and any other files at this point, then type `git commit -a -m "my first update"`
- Finally commit these initial changes by typing `git push -u origin master`

From there code and work as per normal with this little jumpstart :)
